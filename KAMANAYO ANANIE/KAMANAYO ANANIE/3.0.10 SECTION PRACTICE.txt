//Arithmetic operators
//Exercise 1: Fill in the missing operators to get the expected result (replace the underscore symbol with the appropriate operator):

console.log(2*3+1);      // expected 7  (Multiplication first: 3 * 1 = 3, then addition: 2 + 3 = 7)
console.log(2**4);         // expected 16 (Exponentiation: 2^4 = 16)
console.log(5*1);          // expected 5  (Multiplication: 5 * 1 = 5)
console.log(8**2-5**2);  // expected 39 (Multiplication first: 8 * 2 = 64, 5 ** 2 = 25, then addition: 16 + 10 = 39)

//Comparison operators
//Exercise 2: Fill in the missing comparison operators in that such a way that all expressions result in true (replace the underscore symbol with the appropriate operator):

console.log(4 * 5 === 20);   // true (20 is exactly equal to 20)
console.log(6 * 5 == 30);  // true (30 == "30" )
console.log(-17 < 0);        // true (-17 is less than 0)
console.log(25 > 1);         // true (25 is greater than 1)
console.log(2 + 2 * 2 > 4);  // true (Multiplication first: 2 * 2 = 4, then addition: 2 + 4 = 6, 6 > 4)



//Logical operators
//Exercise 3: Fill in the missing comparison operators in that such a way that all expressions result in true (replace the underscore symbol with the appropriate operator):

console.log(true || false);        // true (OR: At least one operand is true)
console.log(false == false);       // true (Equality: false is equal to false)
console.log(false || false || true); // true (OR: At least one operand is true)
console.log(true || false || (false && true)); // true (false && true is false, so OR makes it true)
